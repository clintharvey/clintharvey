- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a frontend dev. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript with the freeCodeCamp program. I'm about half way through the javascript section and am completely overwhelmed, afraid that I'm stuck doing the wrong stuff. Everything I see talks about how easy javascript is but it seems to stump me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... new projects to get more exsposer to different (idea's, styles).
- 📫 How to reach me on github
- 😄 Pronouns: ...none
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I'm an old electrician that has an averge skill but inpeccable will. "I'm not going to give up on my dream of becoming a dev!"
